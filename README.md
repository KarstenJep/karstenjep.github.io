# Personal Website / Portfolio

## Description
Duration: Ongoing

What started as a fun, quick foray into playing with basic animations in javascript, has now evolved into a fully animated react app that doubles as my personal website. This will be a project I will revisit periodically in my free time to further practice animation, experiment with interactive user experience, and look for opportunities to improve.

## [Demo](https://karstenjep.github.io/)


## EDA Project
This application uses React, Redux, Material-UI, CSS, EmailJS (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`)

## Development Setup Instructions
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` command will open up a browser tab for you at `localhost:3000`

## Lay of the Land
Directory Structure:

- `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
- `build/` contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site

 1. User lands on the "About Me" page and is presented with a blurb about the developer
 2. User can navigate to the "Portfolio", "Contact" pages or to the developers LinkedIn, GitHub
 3. The "Portfolio" page requires the user to scroll through animations before being presented with projects
 4. The "Contact" page allows the user to send a message directly to the developers email
