# Personal Website / Portfolio

## Description
Duration: Ongoing

What started as a fun, quick foray into playing with basic animations in javascript, has now evolved into a fully animated react app that doubles as my personal website. This will be a project I will revisit periodically in my free time to further practice animation, experiment with interactive user experience, and look for opportunities to improve.

## [Demo](https://karstenjep.github.io/)
